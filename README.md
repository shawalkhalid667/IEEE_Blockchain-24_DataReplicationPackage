## Data Collection

* TweetingCryptoAnalysisDataset.xlsx: Dataset containing the X crypto signal data of popular crypto-related tweets, cryptocurrency value metrics for before and after signals, and data regarding the replies to crypto signal posts (Tweets Replies Data tab).

* replies.py: Script to collect the comments replying from users on crypto signals in our dataset.


## Overview
Social media platforms have significantly influenced user behavior and market values within the cryptocurrency industry. However, assessing this impact poses challenges due to market volatility and evolving mechanisms. In response, this project investigates user perceptions of crypto signals on X (formerly Twitter). We introduce the CryptoSignalMonitor dataset and conduct a preliminary analysis to understand the impact of X crypto signals on user behavior and investment decisions.


## Key Findings
- **Dataset Summary**: We collected 100 posts meeting our criteria from 63 different influencers on X.
- **Represented Cryptocurrencies**: The dataset includes signals for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Binance, and Shiba Inu.
- **Influencer Insights**: We observed signals from a diverse group of influencers, including cryptocurrency experts, actors, athletes, musicians, and meme accounts.
- **Impact Analysis**: Our findings demonstrate that users frequently engage with crypto signals on social media, correlating with a significant increase in cryptocurrency values.

## Future Directions
- **Dataset Expansion**: Future iterations can expand the dataset to include additional posts and influencers for further analysis.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Further exploration of temporal trends in crypto signal engagement and market impact.
- **User Behavior Studies**: Deeper investigation into user behavior and decision-making processes influenced by crypto signals.

## Repository Contents
- **Dataset Files**: Includes the CryptoSignalMonitor dataset and data collection scripts.
- **Analysis Scripts**: Scripts used for preliminary analysis and visualization of the dataset.
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation on dataset construction and analysis methods.
